    <h2>Sound</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite passion is sound design. I love to go out and record sounds in
      the world and manipulate them into something else later using software. I
      love to create sounds for movies, TV, games and podcasts.

    <h3>Wall-E</h3>
    <p>
      This movie sounds INCREDIBLE. I love how the first 20 minutes has no
      dialogue, and sounds drive the storytelling. Wall-E's voice is so cute.
      For those interested, Ben Burtt was the sound designer on that movie. He
      is mostly known for his work on Star Wars.
